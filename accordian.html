        The AI revolution is upon us. Soon, fusion-powered, self-duplicating, AI
        robots will be cranking out unlimited food, semaglutides, money, and

        conversationalist. Now is the time to start reading interesting books
        and perfecting the timeless art of conversation! Alternatively, you may

        An Impromptu Book Club is a one-off book club that discusses a
        particular book and disbands. An Impromptu club can meet over one or
        more sessions. Perhaps you want to start with a 15-minute happy hour
        meet & greet before you even discuss the book? Perhaps your book is
        1,000 pages long, and you want to discuss it over the course of 3
        meetings? Maybe you want to do the whole book at once? Join an Impromptu
        Book Club to meet random new people.
